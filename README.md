# texture-generator
It's a website that generates textures

## plan for file structure
Each type of texture is contained in a script in a folder, each one has a class that extends a base class.
Each class specifies the options, a function to add the options to the config, and a render function that changes an `ImageData` variable.

## plan for textures
- white noise
- blue noise
- voronoi noise
- perlin noise
- fractal sine waves
